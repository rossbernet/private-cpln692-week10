# Week 10, Lab 2 â€” Introduction to Carto

## Task

This assignment is relatively open ended. Here are a few tasks you should complete:

- Upload a dataset to carto
- Try to modify your dataset in the dataset editor
- Load your visualization in your own Leaflet map; edit main.js and open index.html
- Try editing the CartoCSS so that different parts of your dataset have different styles
- Use the Analysis feature, try three of the analysis types that seem especially interesting
- Pick the analysis type that looked the best; export the analysis to GeoJSON; you can
  reload this in Carto or use L.geoJson to map it
- Check out the public dataset library, find a dataset that seems interesting and map it

If you have extra time, import another dataset, either one you are using for a different class or
a previous dataset from this class. Play around with it in Carto.
